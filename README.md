In this section, I've implemented a basic smart contract for ICO of a cryptotoken PiCoin. PiCoin will be in an enclosed environment where mathematicians can propose their ideas and have initial funding.
Remix Ethereum IDE was used for creating the smart contract. Further, MyEtherWallet v3.21.06 was used along with Ganache for testing out the smart contract.
This entire project is meant for educational purposes to understand the concept and working of Smart Contracts, ICO etc.
